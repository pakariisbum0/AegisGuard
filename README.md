# OneVault - AI DeFi Agent

## Project Description

Meet **OneVault**, your AI-powered DeFi Agentâ€”a fully autonomous system that executes, optimizes, and adapts DeFi strategies based on your risk preferences. Designed with a user-friendly UI, OneVault simplifies interaction with DeFi protocols across the **Sonic blockchain ecosystem**, maximizing returns while minimizing complexity for both power users and newcomers.

### ðŸ”¹ Why OneVault?

Take **EigenLayer restaking** as an example: users typically need to research assets, select operators, and assess risks tied to Active Validated Services (AVS)â€”a daunting task for the average user. OneVaultâ€™s conversational AI Agent simplifies this by filtering high-quality operators, assessing security, and tailoring strategies to your needs, all powered by Sonicâ€™s 10,000 TPS and sub-second finality.

### ðŸ”¹ What It Does

- **Automated Strategy Execution**: No manual transactionsâ€”just pick your risk level (Low, Medium, High), and the AI handles everything.
- **AI-Powered Guidance**: Ask about DeFi strategies, risks, or returns, and get real-time, context-aware answers.
- **Seamless Multicall3 Execution**: Combines Morpho lending, EigenLayer restaking, and Uniswap liquidity provision into a single, gas-efficient transaction on Sonic.

### ðŸ”¹ How It Works

1. Deposit **USDC/USDT** into your personal vault on Sonic.
2. Select a strategy (Low, Medium, High risk) or let the AI guide you.
3. Sign onceâ€”the AI Agent executes via Sonicâ€™s EVM-compatible blockchain.
4. Track & optimizeâ€”the AI adapts strategies based on market conditions, leveraging Sonicâ€™s high-performance infrastructure.

Built for the next generation of DeFi, OneVault deploys capital smartly, autonomously, and with a gamified twist: **Play. Deploy. Earn.**

## How It's Made

Weâ€™ve integrated **Morpho**, **EigenLayer Restaking**, and **Uniswap** on the Sonic blockchain, using **Multicall3** to bundle contract calls into gas-efficient transactions. Sonicâ€™s sub-second finality and EVM compatibility ensure fast, scalable execution.

### DeFi Strategies

1. **Morpho**: Calls `supply()` to deposit assets into Morpho markets, earning yield on idle funds.
2. **EigenLayer**: Uses `depositIntoStrategyWithSignature()` for simplified staking with a single signature.
3. **Uniswap**: Employs a custom liquidity router interacting with `mint()` in `NonfungiblePositionManager` for seamless liquidity provision.

### AI Agent Integration with ZerePy

We leverage **ZerePy** to enhance automation and user interaction:

- **AI Agent Planner**: Organizes tasks for efficient strategy execution.
- **AI Agent Summarizer**: Aggregates and summarizes the latest DeFi news, powered by ZerePyâ€™s social and blockchain integrations.
- **AI Agent Organizer**: Uses RAG technology with a **Qdrant Vector Database** to retrieve and deliver relevant DeFi data.

ZerePyâ€™s Sonic integration enables:

- `send-sonic`: Transfers S tokens for transaction fees.
- `swap-sonic`: Executes token swaps on Sonic DEX with custom slippage control.
- `get-sonic-balance`: Monitors vault balances in real-time.

### AI RAG Implementation

- **Embedding**: Data is embedded using **OpenAIâ€™s text-embedding-3-small** model and stored in a **Qdrant Vector Database**.
- **Retrieval**: Cosine similarity retrieves the most relevant data chunks based on user queries, fed into an LLM for natural responses.

By combining Multicall3, ZerePyâ€™s AI agents, and Sonicâ€™s blockchain, OneVault delivers a gas-efficient, user-friendly, and automated DeFi experience.

## Sonic Integration

OneVault runs on the **Sonic blockchain** (Chain ID: 146, RPC: [https://rpc.soniclabs.com](https://rpc.soniclabs.com)), leveraging:

- **10,000 TPS & Sub-Second Finality**: Ensures rapid strategy execution.
- **S Token**: Pays transaction fees and supports staking for governance.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates Morpho, EigenLayer, and Uniswap contracts.
- **ZerePy Sonic Commands**: Manages transactions (`send-sonic`), swaps (`swap-sonic`), and balance tracking (`get-sonic-balance`).
